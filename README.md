COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL. The analysis is done on data covering cases, deaths, and vaccinations from various countries across different time periods.

📌 Project Objective
The goal is to gain insights such as death rates, infection percentages, population-level impacts, and vaccination progress by writing and executing SQL queries on structured data.

📁 Dataset Details
The data comes from Our World in Data and includes two main tables:

CovidDeaths

CovidVaccinations

Both were imported as CSV files into SQL Server for analysis.

🛠 Tools Used
Microsoft SQL Server

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Basic SQL (SELECT, JOIN, CTE, Temp Tables, Views, Aggregates)

🔍 Key Insights
Countries with the highest death and infection rates

Percentage of population infected or vaccinated

Rolling vaccination progress using window functions

Global and continent-wise death counts

Visual-ready views for future dashboards

💡 Techniques Highlighted
This project demonstrates the use of CTEs, temporary tables, window functions (OVER(PARTITION BY...)), and joins to analyze time-series health data effectively.
